# Understanding and Applying Text Embeddings

### About this short course

The Vertex AI Text-Embeddings API enhances the process of generating text embeddings. These text embeddings, which are numerical representations of text, play a pivotal role in many tasks involving the identification of similar items, like Google searches, online shopping recommendations, and personalized music suggestions.

During this course, you’ll use text embeddings for tasks like classification, outlier detection, text clustering and semantic search. You’ll combine semantic search with the text generation capabilities of an LLM to build a question-answering systems using Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.

You’ll also explore:
- The properties of word and sentence embeddings
- How embeddings can be used to measure the semantic similarity between two pieces of text
- How to apply text embeddings for tasks such as classification, clustering, and outlier detection
- Modify the text generation behavior of an LLM by adjusting the parameters temperature, top-k, and top-p
- How to apply the open source ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors) library for efficient semantic search
- How to build a Q&A system by combining semantic search with an LLM 

Upon successful completion of this course, you will grasp the underlying concepts of using text embeddings, and will also gain proficiency in generating embeddings and integrating them into common LLM applications.
